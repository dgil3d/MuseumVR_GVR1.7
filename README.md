# MuseumVR


Released: 8-8-2017
Versions: Unity Version 5.6.1 and Google VR SDK Version 1.7

MuseumVR is a VR application designed to educate Curators and Museum Directors on the benefits that VR/AR technology can bring to their exhibits.  Mixed reality literally makes the possibilities endless and this application will guide the user through a small exhibit floor showcasing some of the capabilities and current-day applications of VR.

Just look at the ground where you want to go and click to dash forward. Red orbs identify stations that can be toggled on and off. I hope you enjoy.
